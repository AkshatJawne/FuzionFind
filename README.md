## FuzionFind


FuzionFind is a next-gen file search utility that combines CUDA-accelerated fuzzy string matching with neural network ranking to deliver fast, highly accurate file search results. 

What makes it unique is its hybrid scoring mechanism that simultaneously evaluates three distinct signals: GPU-accelerated Levenshtein distance calculations for string similarity, TF-IDF statistical relevance scores derived from filename linguistics, and neural network evaluations that learn from user behavior patterns. 

By synthesizing these complementary approaches, FuzionFind achieves remarkable accuracy even with partial or misspelled queries.
